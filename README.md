# Hiring
The first stage of the hiring process at Hatch is to use our application to create a profile and apply to the role.
This allows you to get a better understanding of the Student Experience side of our marketplace, and allows us to get more information about you than a normal resume allows.

__During the sign-up and application process you may encounter references to students or part-time work, you can ignore these discrepencies, this is a full time role for an experienced candidate.__

## Step 1
Sign-up to Hatch [here](https://www.hatch.team/student/signup). 
 - You can upload dummy data for the Education questions and transcripts.
 - We don't use the Assessments for these hires, so just click random answers to save time (or do it for fun!), but they will need to be complete before the system lets you do Step 2.

## Step 2
Once you have a compeleted a Hatch account, you can apply to the role [here](https://www.hatch.team/role/186).
This will require you to answer a few more questions and submit some video responses.
When answering the experience questions, you can put anything in the title and context text boxes. Answer the main question on the left in the last text area.

**Once you have completed all steps you will receive an automated email from us confirming we have received your application**

This is a screening interview, you'll be assessed on your answers to the video and experience questions.
